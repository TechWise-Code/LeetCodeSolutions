# LeetCode Solutions by TechWise 🚀

## Introduction

Welcome to our LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by problem number and difficulty. We've created this repository as part of our journey with TechWise to document progress and share approaches to solving algorithmic problems.

## Purpose ✨

The primary goals of this repository are to:

1. Document solutions to LeetCode problems
2. Provide the code for the explanations on LeetCode
3. Demonstrate multiple approaches to solving problems when applicable
4. Help fellow programmers understand the thought process behind problem-solving
5. Create a resource for beginners to advanced programmers to learn from

## Solution Structure 📝

Each LeetCode solution follows a detailed and structured format designed to maximize learning and understanding:

1. **Problem Description**: A brief summary of the problem, inputs, and expected outputs.
2. **Initial Thoughts**: Our first impressions and understanding of the problem.
3. **Solutions**: At least one approach (but usually multiple) sorted by complexity/difficulty, each containing:
   - Approach Description
   - Testing and Validation Test Cases
   - Pseudocode
   - Code
   - Explanation
   - Complexity Analysis
4. **Further Explanation and Visualization**: Additional insights, diagrams, or explorations to enhance understanding.

## Important Notes 📌

- Multiple solutions are only provided when we've solved the problem using different approaches
- Currently, all code examples are written in Python, so explanations may be biased toward Python conventions and libraries
- Solutions are continuously updated and improved as we learn new techniques
